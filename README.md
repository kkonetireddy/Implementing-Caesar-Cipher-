Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption
Description
This program implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique that shifts the letters of a message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. It allows users to either encrypt or decrypt messages.

Features
Encrypt messages using a specified shift value.
Decrypt messages that were previously encrypted with the same shift value.
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
Requirements
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
Standard C++ libraries
How to Compile
Save the code in a file named caesar_cipher.cpp.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Compile the program using the following command:
g++ caesar_cipher.cpp -o caesar_cipher
How to Run
After compiling, you can run the program with:

./caesar_cipher
Usage
The program will prompt you to choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message. Enter E for encryption or D for decryption.
Enter the message you want to process.
Enter the shift value (an integer). For example, a shift of 3 means each letter will be moved three positions forward in the alphabet.
The program will output the encrypted or decrypted message based on your choice.
Example
Encrypting
Would you like to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? E
Enter the message: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted Message: Khoor, Zruog!
Decrypting
Would you like to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? D
Enter the message: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the shift value: 3
Decrypted Message: Hello, World!
Limitations
The program does not handle negative shift values in a special way; it simply shifts letters backwards.
Non-alphabetical characters are not modified.
